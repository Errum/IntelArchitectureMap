# Intelligence Architecture Mind Map

The Intelligence Architecture Mind Map is based on interviews of industry experts in cyber security, former intelligence practitioners, and open-source research (plus a little of my personal views). It represents a logical and meaningful way the different aspects of producing intelligence should be put together for cyber security at all levels. The mind map is not meant to be THE way of doing things, but more as guide for how everything CAN be done. Pick and choose what you want to implement and build and expand as you go.

I wrote a short comment that describes the architecture mind map and the process, which can be found here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/intelligence-architecture-map-freddy-m/

For a much more detailed version compared to the image I would highly suggest you download the PDF by right-clicking and download:

PS! The mind map has grown quite a bit since this project first started and thus the PNG file and quality isn't all that great. I'd suggest you use the PDF file as you can zoom into and still have everything clear regardless of zoom level.

If you just want the image you can right-click and select download/save as
